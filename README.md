This repository contains all the raw code of my work for BRI studying bird species distribution shifts in Maine.
No raw data  are included in this repository as they are the property of BRI.
The best way to analyze the fraction of work presented here is to peruse the analysis.Rmd or analysis.html document. They are both the same document in different formats.
The document data-manipulation.Rmd mearly cotains code to clean, restructure, and add geographic data such as elevation to the two datasets from 1983 and 2019.
The pdf bird_species_shift_basic_summary is a one-page description of my work at BRI.
Data analysis and research for a paper that I plan to publish on the geographic shifts among bird species in Maine is ongoing.
